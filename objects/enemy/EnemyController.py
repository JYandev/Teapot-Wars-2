        Enemy controllers do exactly what there name implies - they act as the
         AI controller for the NPCs.
        Each enemy controller makes decisions on an interval which is randomly
         chosen after a decision is made. Decisions are limited, of course, by
         the character's energy level.
        These controllers should only be running on the Host player's game.
         the actions of these creatures should only be synced to the remote
         clients.
